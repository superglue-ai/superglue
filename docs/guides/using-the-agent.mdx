The superglue agent handles system setup, API discovery, and tool building through a chat interface. Talk to it in natural language — it handles the technical details.

## Available superglue agent tools

The agent uses a broad range of tools to help you manage your systems and tools:

    **`call_endpoint`** - Test API endpoints directly with credential injection
    
    **`authenticate_oauth`** - Complete OAuth authorization flows for systems
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Building & Execution" icon="wrench">
    **`build_tool`** - Build a new tool from natural language instructions
    
    **`edit_tool`** - Modify an existing tool's configuration or steps
    
    **`run_tool`** - Execute a saved tool with optional input payload
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting up a system via OAuth

Configure OAuth flows without touching code. The agent walks you through system setup, handles the authorization code flow and stores your credentials securely.

</video>

**What this shows:**
- You can set up and run the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow in the chat with one click
- The agent checks your existing systems to prevent duplicate setup
- The agent automatically stores your credentials and automatically verifies your setup

</video>

**What this shows:**
- You can upload documentation as files directly in the chat
- The agent can extract endpoint information from uploaded docs
- The agent automates endpoint discovery and parameter inference and enables API interaction through conversation
