description: "How to interact with the superglue agent"
---

The superglue agent handles integration setup, API discovery, and tool building through a chat interface. Talk to it in natural language — it handles the technical details.

<Note>
  The agent is available in the hosted version at [app.superglue.cloud](https://app.superglue.cloud). For self-hosted MCP usage, see the [MCP guide](/mcp/using-the-mcp).

## Setting up an integration via OAuth

Configure OAuth flows without touching code. The agent walks you through integration setup, handles the authorization code flow and stores your credentials securely.

 <video
      autoPlay
      className="w-full rounded-lg"
      src="../resources/using-agent-oauth.mp4"
    />

**What this shows:**
- You can set up and run the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow in the chat with one click
- The agent checks your existing integrations to prevent duplicate setup
- The agent automatically stores your credentials and automatically verifies your setup

## Talk to your APIs

Point the agent at your custom APIs. It can test endpoints, authentication, and build working tools based on exploration.

<video autoPlay className="w-full rounded-lg">
  <source src="../resources/using-agent-talk-to-APIs.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

**What this shows:**
- You can upload documentation as files directly in the chat
- The agent can extract endpoint information from uploaded docs
- The agent automates endpoint discovery and parameter inference and enables API interaction through conversation
