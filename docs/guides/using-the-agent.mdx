description: "How to interact with the superglue agent"
---

The superglue agent handles integration setup, API discovery, and tool building through a chat interface. Talk to it in natural language — it handles the technical details.

<Note>
  The agent is available in the hosted version at [app.superglue.cloud](https://app.superglue.cloud). For self-hosted MCP usage, see the [MCP guide](/mcp/using-the-mcp).

## Setting up an integration via OAuth

Configure OAuth flows without touching code. The agent walks you through integration setup, handles the authorization code flow and stores your credentials securely.

<video src="VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER_OAUTH_SETUP" />

**What this shows:**
- Starting an OAuth integration from chat
- Agent generates redirect URI and client configuration
- One-click authorization flow
- Automatic credential storage and refresh token handling

---

## Discovering obscure API endpoints

Point the agent at undocumented APIs. It can test endpoints, test authentication, and build working tools based on exploration.

<video src="VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER_API_DISCOVERY" />

**What this shows:**
- Providing API base URL and initial documentation
- Agent testing authentication schemes
- Automatic endpoint discovery and parameter inference
- Building knowledge base from API responses

---

## Building and testing complex tools

Build multi-step workflows that coordinate across systems. Agent generates, tests, and iterates on tools based on natural language descriptions.

<video src="VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER_TOOL_BUILDING" />

**What this shows:**
- Describing a tool: "Query postgres schema, send to OpenAI for summary, save result"
- Agent breaks down into steps: DB introspection, LLM call, storage
- Iterative testing with real data
- Handling errors and refining tool building instructions
