<Info>
  **Enterprise Feature** — Permissioning and identity provider integration is
  available on superglue Enterprise plans. [Contact
  us](https://cal.com/superglue/superglue-demo) to learn more.
</Info>

superglue Enterprise supports fine-grained access control by connecting to your existing identity systems. Define exactly which users, service accounts, and AI agents can execute which tools—ensuring your automations stay secure and compliant.

## Identity provider integration

Connect superglue to your organization's identity provider for centralized user management and single sign-on:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Microsoft Entra ID" icon="microsoft">
    Sync users and groups from Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID. Supports SAML and
    OIDC.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Okta" icon="key">
    Integrate with Okta for SSO and automatic user provisioning via SCIM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Workspace" icon="google">
    Connect Google Workspace for identity federation and group sync.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom OIDC/SAML" icon="shield-halved">
    Connect any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Connecting Microsoft Entra ID

```typescript
// Example: Configure Microsoft Entra ID integration
const identityConfig = {
  provider: "microsoft",
  tenantId: "your-tenant-id",
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
  scopes: ["User.Read", "GroupMember.Read.All"],
};
```

Once connected, superglue automatically syncs:

- User identities and email addresses
- Group memberships
- Role assignments

## Access control model

superglue uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model with three layers:

| Layer            | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization** | Top-level access to the superglue instance    |
| **Tool**         | Which tools a user/agent can view and execute |
| **Integration**  | Which API credentials a user/agent can use    |

### Defining permissions

Assign permissions to users, groups, or service accounts:

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "your_api_key_here",
});

// Grant a user permission to execute a specific tool
await superglue.grantPermission({
  principalId: "user@company.com",
  principalType: "user",
  resourceType: "tool",
  resourceId: "sync-stripe-customers",
  permission: "execute",
});

// Grant a group permission to all tools in a namespace
await superglue.grantPermission({
  principalId: "sales-team",
  principalType: "group",
  resourceType: "tool",
  resourceId: "sales/*",
  permission: "execute",
});
```

### Permission levels

| Permission | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`     | Can see the tool configuration and execution history    |
| `execute`  | Can run the tool with any payload                       |
| `edit`     | Can modify the tool configuration                       |
| `admin`    | Full control including delete and permission management |

## Controlling agent access

AI agents accessing superglue through the SDK or MCP can be scoped to specific tools and integrations:

### SDK authentication

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";

// Create a scoped client for an AI agent
const agentClient = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "agent_scoped_api_key",
  // This key only has access to tools the agent needs
});

// Agent can only execute tools it has permission for
const result = await agentClient.executeWorkflow({
  id: "approved-tool-id",
  payload: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

### MCP tool filtering

When using superglue as an MCP server, you can filter which tools are exposed to AI agents:

```typescript
// MCP server configuration with tool filtering
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "superglue-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SUPERGLUE_API_KEY": "agent_scoped_api_key",
        "SUPERGLUE_API_URL": "https://your-instance.superglue.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent will only see and be able to execute tools that match its API key's permissions.

## Audit logging

All tool executions are logged with identity context:

```typescript
// Query audit logs
const logs = await superglue.getAuditLogs({
  resourceType: "tool",
  resourceId: "sync-stripe-customers",
  startDate: "2025-01-01",
  endDate: "2025-01-31",
});

// Each log entry includes:
// - Who executed the tool (user, agent, or service account)
// - When it was executed
// - What payload was provided
// - Whether it succeeded or failed
// - How long it took
```
