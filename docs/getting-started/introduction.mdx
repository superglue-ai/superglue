superglue is an AI-native integration platform for the glue code holding your systems together.
Build tools to sync, migrate, integrate, and manage legacy systems without writing custom integration code in minutes instead of months.

## Why use superglue?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Works with obscure legacy systems" icon="server">
    superglue does not rely on templates and pre-built connectors. It understands documentation,
    custom auth patterns, rate limiting and misleading HTTP 200 status code errors that plague
    legacy integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Tool & Workflow Building" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Stop wiring up endpoints, query parameters and auth headers by hand — superglue does this for
    you. Specify only what your tool and workflow does in natural language, superglue handles the
    rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Talk to your Integrations" icon="comments">
    Set up authentication, upload documentation, or add custom integration instructions — all via a
    chat interface. superglue automates requirements gathering by running web search, reading
    documentation and testing API endpoints.
  </Card>

## How superglue works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Integrations">
    Add REST, GraphQL, SOAP, XML-RPC, Postgres databases, FTP/SFTP, or local
    file systems. Handles OAuth, API
    keys, basic auth, custom headers, certificate auth, and session-based flows.
  </Step>

<Step title="Build Tools">
  Describe what you need in natural language. The agent understands your integrations and generates
  executable tools that work across your systems. Handles JSON, XML, CSV, fixed-width files, and
  custom formats.
</Step>

  <Step title="Execute & Observe">
    Run tools on-demand, schedule them, or trigger via webhooks. Full execution logs, retry logic, and error notifications. Intelligence layer tracks API behavior, identifies breaking changes, and auto-repairs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What runs on superglue

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="System Migrations" icon="arrows-turn-right">
    Migrate data from legacy ERP, CRM, and custom databases to modern platforms. Handle complex
    schema transformations, validate data integrity, and roll back on failures. Track progress
    across multi-stage migrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Syncs" icon="rotate">
    Keep legacy systems in sync with modern platforms during transition periods. Bi-directional data
    flows, conflict resolution, and scheduled updates. Handle SOAP, XML-RPC, fixed-width files, and
    FTP/SFTP.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Legacy Integration Tools" icon="server">
    Build tools that connect legacy ERP, warehouse management systems, and legacy SaaS to your
    modern stack. Upload custom documentation, include integration specific instructions and let
    superglue handle the rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-Driven Automation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Give AI agents the ability to query legacy databases, trigger batch jobs, extract reports, and
    coordinate across disconnected systems. Schedule tool execution and notify external systems via
    webhooks.
