The core idea of superglue is to let users connect their systems via a natural language interface that abstracts away the pain of authentication, structuring requests and mapping data between systems. This page explains key concepts - integrations, tools and self-healing - that are the essential building blocks of everything superglue does.

The superglue concept for all systems superglue supports is called **integrations**. Within superglue, an integration is any system that can provide, store or process data.

We want to emphasize that an integration can be **any system** with an API - REST, GraphQL, SOAP - **but also** an FTP/SFTP server or a Postgres database. This is a conscious choice. Instead of having a connector library and only supporting a fixed number of integrations, we purposefully take a more generalizable approach. This means that users can build and configure **any integration** with custom documentation, custom URLs, custom authentication and specific instructions tailored to their use case.
Think of integrations as **reusable building blocks** that store all context required to work with a system. To find out more about the many different ways to create integrations on superglue, check the [integrations guide](/guides/creating-an-integration).

superglue is an AI-powered **tool builder** that builds on top of a user's integrations. Tools are built according to user instructions and execute **sequentially**. Every tool takes a number of (optional) inputs, executes a series of tool steps and returns an output.
Tool inputs can include the integrations that this tool will use, a payload of tool variables (e.g. a timestamp, a user ID or something similar) or files.
Tools will **execute deterministically** once they are saved, but are built and auto-evaluated using large language models. For more details on tool building, please check out our [tool guide](guides/creating-a-tool).

<Note>
  In some places in the [client SDK](sdk/overview) and documentation we may still be referring to
  **workflows**, which is the now **deprecated** legacy naming for tools. For all intents and
  purposes, the two phrases **refer to the same** concept.

Self-healing is a functionality within superglue that **auto-repairs broken tools.** A tool built by superglue can contain broken or misconfigured steps if user instructions are inaccurate, the documentation is incomplete, or the build agent is missing context.

When executing a built tool, superglue has an auto-repair mode that lets it "self-heal" broken tool steps **during execution**. Enabling this mode will re-generate individual tool steps to fix issues like deprecated endpoints, misconfigured authentication, inaccurate use of query params, or data mapping errors. Self-healing takes place **at workflow step level** and uses generated step instructions for guidance. Self-healing is only invoked if a step fails to execute successfully. Self-healing can be enabled anytime you execute a tool, but makes execution **non-deterministic**.
