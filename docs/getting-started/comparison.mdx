#### Generalizes to obscure, complex legacy systems
- superglue does not rely on templates and pre-built connectors.
- Understands documentation, specific instructions and custom auth patterns and builds on your custom systems  
- Handles **rate limiting**, **network flakiness**, and misleading **HTTP 200 error messages** (all of which we have often encountered in the past) 

#### Automates Tool & Multi-Step Workflow Building
- Stop wiring up endpoints by hand — superglue builds tools for you.
- No need to specify **endpoints**, **query strings**, or **custom headers** manually - superglue sets them intelligently based on integration context
- No need to build cURL commands for testing or maintain Postman collection - superglue can handle API exploration for you  
- **Automatic pagination** and looping through previous step results — built-in.  

#### Talks to Your Tools and Integrations
 
- superglue lets you set up authentication, upload documentation, or add custom integration instructions — all via a chat interface
- automates requirements gathering by running web search, extracting knowledge from documentation and testing API endpoints
- Builds and tests tools **iteratively**, powered by **natural language only** — no SDKs, no YAML, no code editor required.
