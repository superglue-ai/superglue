superglue bundles your pipelines into one stable, self-healing endpoint. Comes with automated schema-drift detection, retries and remappings so your data keeps moving no matter what - no connector maintenance, no rewrites. You can deploy it as a proxy between you and any SaaS app, API and data source and always get the data that you want in the format you expect.

- Drop‑in proxy: point it at any REST / GraphQL / SQL / file endpoint.
- LLM‑assisted mapping at setup; cached JSONata transforms at runtime (no LLM latency).
- Self‑healing drift detector: when the upstream schema changes, superglue regenerates the transform, bumps a version, and keeps the pipeline running.
- Security‑first: zero data stored; run fully on‑prem or use our hosted version.
- Agent‑ready: every pipeline is exposed as a single, deterministic endpoint that LangChain, Retool or internal no‑code tools can call without knowing the ugly stuff underneath.

It's open source and easy to run in your own infra.
