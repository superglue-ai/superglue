---

Like many of you, we love using LLMs during development. To make AI coding assistants more effective when working with superglue, we provide our full documentation in a single markdown file that LLMs can easily consume.

## Available Files

We offer two files:

| File | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Index** | [llms.txt](https://docs.superglue.cloud/llms.txt) | Lightweight index of all documentation pages |
| **Full docs** | [llms-full.txt](https://docs.superglue.cloud/llms-full.txt) | Complete documentation in one file |

## How to Use

**If your tool can fetch URLs** (Cursor, Claude, etc.) — just give it the URL and let it pull what it needs.

**If your tool requires file uploads** — download [llms-full.txt](https://docs.superglue.cloud/llms-full.txt) and upload it directly.
