The core idea of superglue is to let users connect their systems via a natural language interface that abstracts away the pain of authentication, structuring requests and mapping data between systems. This page explains key concepts - systems and tools - that are the essential building blocks of everything superglue does.

Systems are the reusable building blocks for tools in superglue. A system represents anything that can provide, store, or process data: REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, SOAP services, SFTP servers, Postgres databases and more.

Instead of maintaining a limited connector library, superglue takes a more general approach. Users can configure any system with custom documentation, URLs, authentication, and instructions tailored to their use case. Think of systems as containers that store all context required to interact with an external service. To learn more about creating systems, check the [systems guide](/guides/creating-a-system).

superglue is an AI-powered **tool builder** that builds on top of a user's systems. Tools are built according to user instructions and execute **sequentially**. Every tool takes a number of (optional) inputs, executes a series of tool steps and returns an output.
Tool inputs can include the systems that this tool will use, a payload of tool variables (e.g. a timestamp, a user ID or something similar) or files.
Tools will **execute deterministically** once they are saved, but are built and auto-evaluated using large language models. For more details on tool building, please check out our [tool guide](/guides/creating-a-tool).

Definitions of what constitutes an agent vary. When we speak about the superglue agent, we are referring to a chat UI that is powered by an LLM with access to a set of custom tools that it can execute on our user's behalf. 
The superglue agent is designed to help you understand what superglue is, how to set up your systems in superglue and how to build tools tailored exactly to your needs and specifications. 
Different agents in superglue may have slightly different tool calling capabilities and context about your tools and systems, but the core concept remains the same.
