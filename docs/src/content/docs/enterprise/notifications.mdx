<Info>
  **Enterprise Feature** — Notifications are available on superglue Enterprise plans. [Contact us](https://cal.com/superglue/superglue-demo) to learn more.
</Info>

When tools run on a schedule, failures can go unnoticed. Notifications alert your team immediately when something breaks.

Configure notifications at [app.superglue.cloud/admin?view=notifications](https://app.superglue.cloud/admin?view=notifications).

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect a channel">
    Set up Slack (or another supported channel) to receive alerts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Send a test notification to verify everything works
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create rules">
    Define which failures should trigger notifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channel setup

  <Tab label="Slack">
    <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full rounded-lg">
      <source src="/resources/notifications.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>

    ### Authentication

    Choose one of two methods:

    | Method | Best for |
    |--------|----------|
    | **Incoming Webhook** | Quick setup, single channel |
    | **Bot Token** | Multiple channels, auto-join public channels |

    Both require a Slack Workspace Admin. The setup wizard guides you through each step.

    ### Message buttons

    - **View Details** — Opens the run in the admin dashboard
    - **Investigate Failure** — Opens the AI agent with failure context

    ### Troubleshooting

    **Notifications not sending**
    - Check that your webhook URL or bot token is valid
    - Ensure at least one notification rule is enabled

    **Bot can't post to channel**
    - Public channels: Bot auto-joins on first message
    - Private channels: Invite manually with `/invite @botname`

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Notification rules

Rules determine which failures trigger notifications.

### Trigger sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scheduler** | Runs triggered by cron schedules |
| **API** | Runs triggered via the REST API or SDK |
| **Webhook** | Runs triggered by incoming webhooks |

<Tip>
  Most teams start with **Scheduler** failures only, since scheduled runs happen without human oversight.
</Tip>

### Tool ID patterns

Filter notifications to specific tools using glob patterns:

- `prod-*` — Only tools starting with "prod-"
- `*-sync` — Only tools ending with "-sync"
- Leave empty to match all tools

## Notification content

Each failure notification includes:

- **Tool name** and failure status
- **Error message** (truncated if long)
- **Failed step** with its description
- **Run metadata** — Run ID, source, timestamp

### Investigate Failure

Notifications include an "Investigate Failure" button that opens the superglue agent with the failed run pre-loaded. The agent explains the error, identifies the root cause, and can fix the tool directly.

### Auto-disable

After repeated delivery failures, superglue automatically disables notifications to prevent spam. Fix the underlying issue, then re-enable in the dashboard.
