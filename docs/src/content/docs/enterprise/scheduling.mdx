Schedule tools to run automatically at specific times or intervals. Scheduled executions run in the background and log results for later review.

## Creating a schedule

</video>

Create schedules from the dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open schedule modal">
    Navigate to your tool and click "Add Schedule"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure frequency">
    Choose from preset intervals (every 5 minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) or enter a custom cron expression

    **Common cron examples:**
    - `*/5 * * * *` - Every 5 minutes
    - `0 9 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 9 AM
    - `0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month
    - `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours

    <Tip>
      Visit [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build and validate cron expressions
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select timezone">
    Choose your timezone to ensure the schedule runs at the correct local time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set input payload (optional)">
    Provide JSON input data that will be passed to each execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and enable">
    Click "Add Schedule" to save. The schedule will start running at the next scheduled time. You can pause it anytime by toggling "Enable schedule" off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing schedules

### Viewing schedules

All schedules for a tool are visible on the tool details page. Each schedule shows:

- Cron expression and human-readable description
- Timezone
- Next scheduled run time
- Last run time and status
- Enable/disable toggle

### Modifying schedules

Click on any schedule to modify:

- Change the cron expression
- Update the timezone
- Modify the input payload
- Enable or disable the schedule

### Deleting schedules

Remove a schedule by clicking the delete button. This stops all future executions but preserves historical run logs.

## Execution behavior

- **Reliability**: Schedules are executed by a dedicated scheduler service with automatic failover
- **Logging**: Every scheduled execution creates a run record with full logs
- **Source tracking**: Scheduled runs are labeled with source `SCHEDULE` in the runs table
- **Error handling**: Failed scheduled runs are logged but don't automatically retry (configure retries in the schedule options)

## Advanced options

When creating a schedule, expand "Advanced Options" to configure:

- **Retries**: Number of retry attempts (0-10) for failed API calls
- **Timeout**: Maximum execution time in milliseconds
- **Webhook**: Send execution results to a URL or trigger another tool when complete
