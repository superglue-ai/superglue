superglue is an AI-native integration platform for the glue code holding your systems together.
Build tools to sync, migrate, integrate, and manage legacy systems without writing custom integration code in minutes instead of months.

## Why use superglue?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Works with any API and legacy system" icon="lucide:server">
    superglue does not rely on templates and pre-built connectors. It understands documentation, custom auth patterns, rate limiting and misleading HTTP 200 status code errors that plague legacy integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Tool Building" icon="lucide:wand-2">
    Stop wiring up endpoints, query parameters and auth headers by hand — superglue does this for you. Specify only what your tool and workflow does in natural language, superglue handles the rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Talk to your Systems" icon="lucide:message-circle">
    Set up authentication, upload documentation, or add custom system instructions — all via a chat interface. superglue automates requirements gathering by running web search, reading documentation and testing API endpoints.

## How superglue works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Systems">
    Add REST, GraphQL, SOAP, Postgres databases, FTP/SFTP, or local
    file systems. Handles OAuth, API
    keys, basic auth, custom headers, certificate auth, and session-based flows.
  </Step>

<Step title="Build Tools">
  Describe what you need in natural language. The agent understands your systems and generates executable tools that
  work across your systems. Handles
  JSON, XML, CSV, fixed-width files, and custom formats.
</Step>

  <Step title="Execute & Observe">
    Run tools on-demand, schedule them, or trigger via webhooks. Full execution logs, retry logic, error notifications, and prod observability.
  </Step>
</Steps>
