Accessing Instagram Business account data involves navigating Meta's complex ecosystem of APIs, OAuth flows, and account linking requirements. superglue streamlines this process by providing a natural language interface you can use to fetch your Instagram business data through Facebook's Graph API.

This guide demonstrates how to:

1. Set up required Instagram Business and Facebook accounts
2. Create a Meta developer app with required permissions
3. Configure OAuth authentication for your instagram integration in superglue
4. Retrieve Instagram posts and metadata using superglue

> **Note:** This guide uses Facebook's Graph API instead of Instagram's Basic Display API, as it provides more functionality for business accounts including insights, comments, and publishing capabilities. Using the Graph API unfortunately requires a LOT of setup. We have done our best to summarize this process here, but refer readers to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) for more detailed information.

## Prerequisites

- An Instagram account (will be converted to Business)
- A Facebook account to link with Instagram
- Access to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- superglue installed and configured (see [Quick Start](/introduction#quick-start) or [app.superglue.cloud](app.superglue.cloud))

## Account Setup

### 1. Create an Instagram Business Account

Convert your Instagram account to a Business account:

1. Open Instagram (mobile app or web)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Account**
3. Select **Switch to Professional Account**
4. Choose **Business** (not Creator)
5. Complete the setup process

### 2. Link to a Facebook Page

Instagram Business accounts must be linked to a Facebook Page:

1. Create a Facebook Page if you don't have one
2. In Instagram settings, go to **Business** → **Page**
3. Select **Connect a Facebook Page**
4. Choose or create a page to link

### 3. Create a Meta Developer App

Set up your app in Meta's developer portal:

1. Visit [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Click **My Apps** → **Create App**
3. Select **Other** as the use case
4. Choose **Business** as the app type
5. Fill in the app details and create

### 4. Configure App Products

Add required products to your app:

1. In your app dashboard, go to **Add Product**
2. Add **Facebook Login for Business**
3. Under **Facebook Login for Business** → **Settings**:
   - Add `https://app.superglue.cloud/api/auth/callback` to Valid OAuth Redirect URIs
4. In **Settings** → **Basic**:
   - Add `app.superglue.cloud` to App Domains
   - Set **App Mode** to **Live** (requires adding a privacy policy URL for your app)

### 5. Register Test Users

For development, register your Instagram account as a test user:

1. Go to **Roles** → **Test Users** in your app dashboard
2. Add your Instagram account email
3. Accept the invitation in Instagram:
   - Go to Instagram web → **Settings** → **Apps and Websites**
   - Accept the test user invitation

## Setting Up an Instagram integration with OAuth in superglue

> **Note:** The Meta Graph API does not fully follow the OAuth 2.0 standards. It provides a long-lived access token without a refresh token that needs to be manually refreshed every 60 days. superglue will flag this, but any Meta integrations will need to be reauthenticated every 60 days.

## Retrieving Instagram Posts

Once authenticated, you can fetch your Instagram business account data and all posts:

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

// Schema for Instagram business account and posts
const instagramSchema = z.object({
  account: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    username: z.string(),
    name: z.string()
  }).describe("Instagram business account linked to the Facebook page"),
  posts: z.array(
    z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      caption: z.string().optional(),
      media_url: z.string(),
      timestamp: z.string()
    })
  ).describe("All posts from the Instagram business account")
});

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_SUPERGLUE_API_KEY"
});

async function fetchInstagramData() {
  const workflow = await superglue.buildWorkflow({
    instruction: "Fetch the instagram business account linked to my facebook page. Retrieve account data and all of my posts.",
    payload: {},
    integrationIds: ["instagram_business"],
    responseSchema: zodToJsonSchema(instagramSchema)
  });

  const result = await superglue.executeWorkflow({
    workflow: workflow
  });

  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Instagram data fetched:", result.data);
    console.log(`Account: @${result.data.account.username}`);
    console.log(`Found ${result.data.posts.length} posts`);
    
    // Example output:
    // {
    //   "account": {
    //     "id": "17841476484763742",
    //     "username": "michael_sg_test",
    //     "name": "Michael Fuest"
    //   },
    //   "posts": [
    //     {
    //       "id": "18084620779798785",
    //       "caption": "Hello world",
    //       "media_url": "https://scontent-muc2-1.cdninstagram.com/...",
    //       "timestamp": "2025-07-31T10:00:11+0000"
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
  } else {
    console.error("Error:", result.error);
  }
}

fetchInstagramData();
```

> **Note:** To access live public data from accounts not registered as test users in your app, your Meta developer app must go through the App Review process. This is required by Meta for production use. See [Meta's App Review documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review) for detailed requirements and submission guidelines.

## Troubleshooting

### "No Instagram Business Account found"
- Verify your Instagram account is converted to Business (not Personal or Creator)
- Check that it's properly linked to a Facebook Page
- Ensure the Facebook Page is accessible by your app

### "Insufficient permissions"
- Confirm all required scopes were approved during OAuth
- Check that your app is in Live mode
- For test users, verify the invitation was accepted in Instagram

### "Invalid OAuth token"
- Re-authenticate by clicking "Connect with OAuth" again
- Check that your app's OAuth redirect URI matches exactly
- Verify App ID and App Secret are correct

## App Review for Production

To access data from non-test users, submit your app for review:

1. Go to **App Review** → **Permissions and Features**
2. Request the required permissions
3. Provide use case descriptions and screencasts
4. Wait for Meta's approval
