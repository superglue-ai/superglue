<Card title="What is superglue?" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone">
  superglue is an **integration layer that uses natural language** to integrate and orchestrate APIs so humans can build faster, and agents can reliably execute across apps and data sources.
</Card>

Instead of writing integration code or custom tools for each API, you describe what you want in plain English. superglue figures out how to connect APIs, transform data, handle errors, and keep everything running smoothly.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Connect Integrations" icon="plug" iconType="duotone">
    **Individual API connections** with credentials and documentation. \
    **Example:** 

    1. 1. Add Stripe integration with your API key

    - 2. Add HubSpot integration with OAuth
    - 3. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Build Workflows" icon="timeline" iconType="duotone">
    **Multi-step orchestrations** described in natural language \
    **Example:**`"Get all customers from Stripe created in the last 30 days"`\
    superglue handles authentication, data transformation, and error recovery.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="Cross-Integration Workflows" icon="link" iconType="duotone">
  **Workflows can span multiple integrations** for complex automation

  **Example:** `"Get new Stripe customers and add them to HubSpot as contacts, then send a Slack notification to our users channel with the count."`

  This single workflow orchestrates Stripe, HubSpot, and Slack integrations.
