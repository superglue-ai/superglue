---

superglue is an AI-native integration platform for the glue code holding your business together.
Build tools to sync, migrate, integrate, and manage legacy systems without writing custom integration code in minutes instead of months.

## Why use superglue

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="AI-Enabled Tool Builder" iconType="duotone">
    Create reusable tools that connect systems in natural language. Execute them
    on-demand, schedule them, or expose them via API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-System Orchestration" iconType="duotone">
    Single tools can orchestrate across databases, APIs, file systems, and
    legacy protocols (FTP/SFTP).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Management" iconType="duotone">
    Ingest documentation from any source. Visualize API structures and
    dependencies. Intelligence layer for agent-driven integration discovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execution Engine" iconType="duotone">
    Reliable execution with automatic retries, error recovery, and
    observability. Handle millions of runs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Native" iconType="duotone">
    First-class MCP support. Use superglue tools directly in your internal GPT,
    Cursor, or Claude.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hostable" iconType="duotone">
    Deploy on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your environment. Full
    control over credentials and secrets.
  </Card>

## How superglue works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Integrations">
    Add REST, GraphQL, SOAP, XML-RPC, databases (SQL/NoSQL), FTP/SFTP, or local
    file systems. Point to documentation and credentials. Handles OAuth, API
    keys, basic auth, custom headers, certificate auth, and session-based flows.
  </Step>

<Step title="Build Tools">
  Describe what you need in natural language. The agent queries the knowledge
  base to understand your integrations, generates executable tools that
  coordinate across your systems, and learns from successful patterns. Handles
  JSON, XML, CSV, fixed-width files, and custom formats.
</Step>

  <Step title="Execute & Observe">
    Run tools on-demand, schedule them, or trigger via webhooks. Full execution logs, retry logic, and error notifications. Intelligence layer tracks API behavior, identifies breaking changes, and suggests optimizations based on execution patterns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What runs on superglue

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="System Migrations" icon="arrows-turn-right">
    Migrate data from legacy ERP, CRM, and custom databases to modern platforms.
    Handle complex schema transformations, validate data integrity, and roll
    back on failures. Track progress across multi-stage migrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Syncs" icon="rotate">
    Keep legacy systems in sync with modern platforms during transition periods.
    Bi-directional data flows, conflict resolution, and scheduled updates.
    Handle SOAP, XML-RPC, fixed-width files, and FTP/SFTP.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Legacy Integration Tools" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Build tools that connect legacy ERP, warehouse management systems, and
    legacy SaaS to your modern stack. Support for SOAP, XML-RPC, file-based
    APIs, obscure auth schemes, and poorly documented endpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-Driven Automation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Give AI agents the ability to query legacy databases, trigger batch jobs,
    extract reports, and coordinate across disconnected systems. Natural
    language interface to decades-old systems.
