The superglue SDK lets you build, execute, and manage tools programmatically. Anything you can do in the UI, you can do with code.

<Note>
    In some places in the SDK and documentation we may still be referring to **workflows**, which is the now **deprecated** legacy naming for tools. For all intents and purposes, the two phrases **refer to the same** concept.
</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @superglue/client
```

## Quick start

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SUPERGLUE_API_KEY
});

// Build a tool with natural language
const workflow = await superglue.buildWorkflow({
  integrationIds: ["stripe"],
  instruction: "Fetch all active customers from Stripe"
});

// Execute it
const result = await superglue.executeWorkflow({
  workflow,
  payload: {}
});

console.log(result.data); // Your Stripe customers
```

## Authentication

Authentication depends on your deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud Platform">
    Get your API key from the superglue dashboard under Settings → API Keys.

    ```typescript
    const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
      apiKey: process.env.SUPERGLUE_API_KEY
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    Use the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable from your `.env` file.

    ```typescript
    const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
      apiKey: process.env.AUTH_TOKEN,
      endpoint: "https://your-self-hosted-instance.com/graphql"
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The client handles authentication automatically for all requests.

## TypeScript

The SDK is fully typed with TypeScript. All types are exported from `@superglue/client`.
