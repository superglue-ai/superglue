Every time a tool runs—whether from the API, a schedule, or the dashboard—superglue saves the complete execution history. When something goes wrong, you have everything you need to understand what happened and fix it.

## The Runs tab

Open the **Runs** tab to see all tool executions across your organization.

Each row shows:

- **Started At** — When the run began
- **Tool** — Which tool was executed
- **Status** — Success, failed, or running
- **Trigger** — How it was started (API, schedule, dashboard, or agent)
- **Details** — Duration for successful runs, or the error message for failures

Click any row to expand it and see the full execution details, including the input payload and step-by-step results.

## Debugging a failed run

When a run fails, you have two ways to investigate:

### Load the run in the playground

Click **Load Run** to open the tool with the exact same inputs that caused the failure. You can:

1. See the payload that was sent
2. Re-run the tool to reproduce the issue
3. Make changes and test until it works
4. Save your fix

This is the fastest way to debug when you already have a hunch about what went wrong.

### Ask the agent to investigate

Click **Investigate** to open a conversation with the superglue agent, pre-loaded with the run's context. The agent can:

- Analyze the error and explain what went wrong
- Look at the step results to find where things broke
- Compare with successful runs to spot differences
- Suggest fixes based on the actual data

This is helpful when the error is unclear or you want a second opinion on what might be causing the issue.

## Enabling run results

Run results can be enabled on superglue via the enterprise plan.

Results are compressed before storage and retained according to your organization's data retention settings.
