<Info>
  **Enterprise Feature** — API key permissioning is available on superglue Enterprise plans. [Contact us](https://cal.com/superglue/superglue-demo) to learn more.
</Info>

superglue uses API keys to control access to tools and APIs. You can create keys with full access or restrict them to specific tools.

## API key types

| Type | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Unrestricted** | Full access to GraphQL, REST, MCP, and all tools |
| **Restricted** | REST and MCP only, limited to specific tools |

## Creating API keys

Create and manage API keys from the dashboard:

  src="/resources/api-keys.png"
  alt="API keys management page"
  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

## Restricted keys

Restricted API keys can only access tools explicitly listed in their `allowedTools` configuration:

| `allowedTools` value | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------|
| `['*']` | All tools allowed (wildcard) |
| `['tool-1', 'tool-2']` | Only these specific tools |

### What restricted keys can do

- Execute tools via REST API (`/v1/tools/{id}/run`)
- Execute tools via MCP server
- List only their allowed tools

### What restricted keys cannot do

- View or execute tools not in their allowed list
- Modify tool configurations

## Use cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Agent Access" icon="robot">
    Create restricted keys for AI agents that only allow access to approved tools
  </Card>
  <Card title="Third-Party Integrations" icon="plug">
    Share restricted keys with external services that only need to trigger specific tools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example: Creating a restricted key for an agent

1. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enable **Restricted access**
4. Select the tools this key should access
5. Copy the generated key

Use this key in your MCP configuration or REST API calls:

```typescript
// MCP server configuration with restricted key
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "superglue-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SUPERGLUE_API_KEY": "sg_restricted_xxx",
        "SUPERGLUE_API_URL": "https://api.superglue.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent will only see and execute tools allowed by this key.
