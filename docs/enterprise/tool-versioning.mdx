  **Enterprise Feature** — Tool versioning is available on superglue Enterprise plans. [Contact us](https://cal.com/superglue/superglue-demo) to learn more.

Every time you save a tool, superglue automatically archives the previous version. View the full change history and restore any previous version with a single click.

## How it works

- **Automatic versioning**: Each save creates a new version in the history
- **Change tracking**: See exactly what changed between versions with diff highlighting
- **One-click restore**: Restore any previous version instantly
- **User attribution**: Track who made each change and when

## Viewing version history

Click the history icon on any tool to open the version history panel. Each entry shows:

- Version number
- Timestamp and author
- Expandable diff showing what changed

## Restoring a version

Click "Restore" on any historical version to revert the tool to that state. The current version is automatically archived before the restore, so you never lose work.
