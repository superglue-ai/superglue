## What superglue Does for You

superglue eliminates the complexity of API integrations and data transformations. Instead of writing boilerplate code for each API, handling schema changes, and managing error cases, you describe what you want in natural language.

[**We're 50% more reliable than LLMs in writing integration code â†’**](https://superglue.ai/api-ranking/)

## Why Use superglue vs Traditional Coding

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="10x Faster Development" icon="rocket">
    **Traditional:** Write API clients, handle pagination, manage schemas, build
    error handling

    **superglue:** Describe your requirements in natural language
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Healing Pipelines" icon="heart">
    **Traditional:** Breaks when APIs change, requires manual fixes \
    **superglue:** Automatically adapts to schema changes and API updates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in Resilience" icon="shield">
    **Traditional:** You implement retries, rate limiting, error handling
    **superglue:** All reliability features included
  </Card>
  <Card title="Universal Access" icon="database">
    **Traditional:** Different code for REST, GraphQL, SQL, CSV, SOAP/XML \
    **superglue:** One interface for all data sources
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The 3-Step Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build" icon="hammer">
    Describe your data pipeline in natural language. superglue figures out the
    API calls, transformations, and error handling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Iterate" icon="map">
    Run and refine your workflow. See exactly what's happening with real-time
    logs and debugging.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Deploy" icon="rocket">
    Save successful workflows for production use. Execute them reliably with
    your own credentials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Pipelines">
    ```typescript
    // Sync HubSpot contacts to your database daily
    await superglue.buildWorkflow({
      id: "hubspot-contacts",
      instruction: "Get all HubSpot contacts updated in last 24 hours and insert into PostgreSQL customers table",
      integrationIds: ["hubspot", "postgresql"]
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Orchestration">
    ```typescript
    // Multi-step workflow across different APIs
    await superglue.buildWorkflow({
      id: "account-flow",
      instruction: "Get Stripe customers, enrich with HubSpot data, and create Jira tickets for high-value accounts",
      integrationIds: ["stripe", "hubspot", "jira"]
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Legacy Migration">
    ```typescript
    // Wrap legacy SOAP APIs with modern interfaces
    await superglue.buildWorkflow({
      id: "soap-migration",
      instruction: "Query legacy inventory system and transform to modern REST API format",
      integrationIds: ["legacy-soap"]
    });
    ```
